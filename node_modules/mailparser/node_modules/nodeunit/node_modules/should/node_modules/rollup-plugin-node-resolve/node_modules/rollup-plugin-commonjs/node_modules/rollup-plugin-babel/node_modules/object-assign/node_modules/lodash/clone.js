var baseClone = require('./_baseClone');

/**
 * Creates a shallow clone of `value`.
 *
 * **Note:** This method is loosely based on the
 * [structured clone algorithm](https://mdn.io/Structured_clone_algorithm)
 * and supports cloning arrays, array buffers, booleans, date objects, maps,
 * numbers, `Object` objects, regexes, sets, strings, symbols, and typed
 * arrays. The own enumerable properties of `arguments` objects are cloned
 * as plain objects. An empty object is returned for uncloneable values suc
